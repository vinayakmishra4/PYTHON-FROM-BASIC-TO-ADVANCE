| --- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 21  | **Lists**                       | Mutable, ordered, indexing, slicing, methods like `append()`, `pop()`, `sort()`. |
| 22  | **Tuples**                      | Immutable, ordered, operations, unpacking, `count()`, `index()`.                 |
| 23  | **KBC CLI Game**                | Trivia game with API integration, lifelines, and a prize ladder.                 |
| 24  | **F-Strings**                   | Modern string formatting, expressions inside `{}`, precision formatting.         |
| 25  | **Docstrings & PEP-8**          | Function/class documentation, readable code standards, style guide.              |
| 26  | **Recursion**                   | Functions calling themselves, base cases, factorial/Fibonacci examples.          |
| 27  | **Sets**                        | Unique, unordered collections, union/intersection/difference, fast membership.   |
| 28  | **Dictionaries**                | Key-value pairs, fast lookups, methods: `get()`, `items()`, `update()`.          |
| 29  | **Exception Handling**          | `try-except-else-finally`, handling errors, building robust programs.            |
| 30  | **`finally` block**             | Guaranteed cleanup code, file/db/network cleanup, context managers.              |
| 31  | **Custom Errors**               | User-defined exceptions, meaningful messages, cleaner debugging.                 |
| 32  | **Caesar Cipher (Secret Code)** | Encode/decode messages with letter shifts.                                       |
| 33  | **`enumerate()`**               | Iterate with index and value, cleaner than `range(len(...))`.                    |
| 34  | **`if __name__ == "__main__"`** | Entry-point control, prevents code execution during imports.                     |
| 35  | **Number Guessing Game**        | Interactive game using loops, conditionals, and random numbers.                  |
| 36  | **Contact Book**                | CRUD operations with dictionaries, file handling, and search.                    |
| 37  | **Review & Mini Projects**      | Applying concepts to mini-programs and games.                                    |
| 38  | **Advanced Recap & Summary**    | Consolidation of concepts, tips, and best practices.                             |

## ✨ Key Concepts Covered

### **Data Structures**

* **Lists & Tuples:** Ordered collections, mutable vs immutable, slicing, iteration.
* **Sets:** Unique, unordered, fast lookups, set operations.
* **Dictionaries:** Key-value mapping, nested dictionaries, fast access.

### **Functions & String Handling**

* F-Strings for formatted, readable output.
* Docstrings for self-documenting code.
* `enumerate()` for looping with index.

### **Control Flow & Error Handling**

* Recursion: solving problems with functions calling themselves.
* `try-except-finally` and **custom exceptions** for robust code.
* `if __name__ == "__main__"` for modular, import-safe scripts.

### **Practical Applications & Projects**

* CLI Games: **KBC Game**, **Number Guessing Game**.
* Caesar Cipher: simple encryption/decryption logic.
* Contact Book: CRUD operations and basic data management.
