# 📘 Python Input Scanner – `input()` Function

**Day 8 – Learning Python Basics**

## 🧠 What is an Input Scanner in Python?

In Python, the term *Input Scanner* refers to the use of the built-in `input()` function that allows a program to take input directly from the user via the keyboard. This is especially useful for interactive programs, such as command-line applications or simple games, where user input is required at runtime.

## 🧾 Description

The `input()` function pauses the program's execution and waits for the user to type some text and press `Enter`. The text entered by the user is then returned as a **string**.

If you want to convert that input into another data type like `int` or `float`, you need to explicitly cast it using type conversion functions such as `int()`, `float()`, etc.

## 🧪 Syntax

```python
variable_name = input("Prompt message")
```

* **`variable_name`**: This is the variable where the input will be stored.
* **`"Prompt message"`**: This is an optional string displayed to the user before taking the input.

## ✅ Basic Example

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", name)
```

### Output:

```
Enter your name: Alice
Hello, Alice
```

---

## 🔄 Type Conversion Example

Since `input()` always returns a string, you’ll often need to convert the input to another type:

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print("You will be", age + 1, "next year.")
```

### Output:

```
Enter your age: 25
You will be 26 next year.
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistake

```python
# Wrong: Trying to perform arithmetic without converting input to int
number = input("Enter a number: ")
print(number + 5)  # This will cause a TypeError
```

### Fix:

```python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(number + 5)
```
