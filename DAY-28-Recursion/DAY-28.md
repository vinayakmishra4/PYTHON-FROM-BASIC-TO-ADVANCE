# Recursion in Python üìñ

---

## Definition üìù
> **Recursion** is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem.  
> Each recursive call should bring the problem closer to a **_base case_**, which stops the recursion.  
> Recursion works by dividing a complex problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems that resemble the original problem.  
> This approach often mirrors mathematical definitions, such as the factorial or Fibonacci sequences, where the solution is expressed in terms of smaller instances of the same problem.

## Syntax üí°
The general syntax of a recursive function in Python:
```python
def recursive_function(parameters):
    if base_case_condition:
        return base_case_value
    else:
        # Recursive call with modified parameters
        return recursive_function(modified_parameters)
```
- ***Parameters***: Inputs to the function that typically change with each recursive call to approach the *base case*.  
- ***Base case***: A condition that stops the recursion by returning a value without making further recursive calls.  
- ***Recursive case***: The part where the function calls itself with modified parameters, moving the problem closer to the *base case*.

## Example ‚öôÔ∏è
Example: Calculating the factorial of a number using recursion.
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```
Another example: Computing the nth Fibonacci number recursively.
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

## Use ‚ú®
Recursion is commonly used for problems that can be broken down into similar subproblems, such as:  
- ‚úÖ Processing tree or graph structures (e.g., traversals)  
- üîÑ Solving mathematical problems (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci sequence)  
- üß© Implementing algorithms like quicksort and mergesort  
- üìÇ Navigating nested data structures  
- üìÇ Parsing expressions in compilers or interpreters  
- üìÇ Traversing directories and file systems  
- üß© Solving backtracking problems like Sudoku, maze solving, and the N-Queens problem

## Features ‚ú®
‚úîÔ∏è A recursive function must have a *base case* to prevent infinite recursion.  
‚úîÔ∏è Each recursive call should progress toward the *base case*.  
‚úîÔ∏è Recursive solutions can be simpler and more elegant for certain problems, improving code clarity.  
‚úîÔ∏è However, recursion can sometimes be less efficient than iteration in terms of performance and memory usage due to call stack overhead.  
‚úîÔ∏è Python does not optimize tail recursion, so deep recursion may lead to stack overflow errors.  
‚úîÔ∏è Debugging recursive functions can be challenging; carefully tracing each call and understanding the call stack is important.  
‚úîÔ∏è Python has a recursion depth limit (default is 1000), which can be changed using `sys.setrecursionlimit()`.  
‚úîÔ∏è Recursion can be less memory-efficient than iteration for large problems due to call stack usage.

## Advantages üåü
- ‚úÖ Simplifies complex problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems.
- üåø Provides cleaner, more readable code for problems like tree/graph traversal.
- ‚ú® Naturally fits problems defined recursively (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci).
- üéØ Useful for algorithms requiring backtracking.

## Disadvantages ‚ö†Ô∏è
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Higher memory usage due to call stack overhead.
- üê¢ Slower execution compared to iteration in many cases.
- üö´ Limited by Python‚Äôs recursion depth.
- üîç Harder to debug and trace recursive calls.
- ‚ùå Lack of tail recursion optimization in Python.
