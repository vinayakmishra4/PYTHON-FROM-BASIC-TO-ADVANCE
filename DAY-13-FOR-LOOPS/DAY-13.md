# 🚀 Day 13: For Loops Statement

Welcome to **Day 13** of your programming journey! Today, we dive into one of the most powerful tools in any language — the **`for` loop**. Let's automate repetition like a pro! 🔁

---

## 🧠 What is a For Loop?

A `for` loop is used to **iterate** over a sequence (like a list, string, or range) and **execute a block of code** for each item.

> 💡 Think of it as a smart way to say: “Hey computer, do this X times!”

---

## 🔧 Syntax (Python)

```python
for variable in iterable:
    # Do something with 'variable'
````

### ✅ Example:

```python
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
for color in colors:
    print(color)
```

🖨️ **Output:**

```
red
green
blue
```

---

## 🎯 Using `range()` Function

The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers, commonly used with loops.

```python
for i in range(5):  # From 0 to 4
    print(i)
```

🔢 **Output:**

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

## 🔍 Real-World Use Cases

* Looping through items in a list
* Automating tasks like printing, summing, or filtering
* Creating patterns or animations
* Accessing characters in a string

### 🔹 Example with `break`:

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
```

## 📌 Summary

✅ `for` loops = control + repetition + automation.
Now you know how to **iterate like a boss**! 💪
