## 🐣 Day 1 – Introduction to Python

Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language used for a wide range of applications. This day covers the basics of Python syntax and how to output information to the screen, which is fundamental for any program.

**Example:**
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

---

## 📦 Day 2 – Variables and Data Types

**Variables** store data values that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. Understanding different **data types** such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans is essential for handling data effectively in Python.

**Example:**
```python
x = 10  # int
```

---

## ➕ Day 3 – Operators

**Operators** allow you to perform operations on variables and values. This includes **arithmetic** operations like addition and subtraction, **comparison** operations to evaluate conditions, and **logical** operations to combine boolean expressions.

**Example:**
```python
a + b
a > b
a and b
```

---

## 🔀 Day 4 – Control Flow

**Control flow** statements like **if**, **else**, and **elif** enable your program to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on conditions. This is key to creating dynamic and responsive programs.

**Example:**
```python
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
```

---

## 🔁 Day 5 – Loops

**Loops** are used to repeat a block of code multiple times, which is useful for tasks like iterating over data or performing repetitive actions. Python primarily uses **for** and **while** loops for iteration.

**Example:**
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

---

## 🛠️ Day 6 – Functions

**Functions** are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. Defining functions helps organize your code, avoid repetition, and make it more readable and maintainable.

**Example:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

---

## 📋 Day 7 – Lists and Tuples

**Lists** and **tuples** are data structures that store collections of items. Lists are **mutable** and can be changed after creation, while tuples are **immutable**. Both are useful for organizing and managing related data.

**Example:**
```python
lst = [1, 2, 3]
```

---

## 🗂️ Day 8 – Dictionaries

**Dictionaries** store data in **key-value pairs**, allowing for fast lookups and efficient data management. They are useful for representing structured data and are a fundamental part of Python programming.

**Example:**
```python
d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
```

---

## 🧩 Day 9 – Sets

**Sets** are unordered collections of unique elements. They are useful when you need to ensure that data contains no duplicates and support operations like **unions** and **intersections**.

**Example:**
```python
s = {1, 2, 3}
```

---

## ✂️ Day 10 – String Manipulation

**Strings** are sequences of characters, and manipulating them is a common task in programming. Python provides many methods for modifying, formatting, and analyzing strings to work with text data effectively.

**Example:**
```python
"hello".upper()
```

---

## 📄 Day 11 – File Handling

**File handling** allows your program to read from and write to files, which is essential for data storage and retrieval. Python makes it easy to work with files for various purposes like logging, data processing, and configuration.

**Example:**
```python
with open('file.txt') as f:
    data = f.read()
```

---

## 🛡️ Day 12 – Exception Handling

**Exception handling** helps your program deal with errors gracefully without crashing. Using **try** and **except** blocks, you can catch and manage exceptions to maintain program stability.

**Example:**
```python
try:
    x = 1/0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    pass
```

---

## 📦 Day 13 – Modules and Packages

**Modules** and **packages** allow you to organize your code into separate files and reuse code across projects. You can also import external libraries to extend Python’s functionality.

**Example:**
```python
import math
math.sqrt(16)
```

---

## ⚡ Day 14 – List Comprehensions

**List comprehensions** provide a concise way to create lists by applying an expression to each item in an iterable. They make your code more readable and often more efficient.

**Example:**
```python
[x*x for x in range(5)]
```

---

## 🌀 Day 15 – Lambda Functions

**Lambda functions** are small anonymous functions defined with the **lambda** keyword. They are useful for short, simple functions that are used temporarily, especially as arguments to higher-order functions.

**Example:**
```python
f = lambda x: x + 1
```

---

## 🔍 Day 16 – Map, Filter, Reduce

These functions support **functional programming** by applying functions to collections of data. **Map** transforms items, **filter** selects items based on conditions, and **reduce** aggregates items into a single value.

**Example:**
```python
list(map(lambda x: x*2, [1,2]))
```

---

## 🐶 Day 17 – Classes and Objects

**Classes** and **objects** are the foundation of **object-oriented programming**. Classes define blueprints for creating objects, which encapsulate data and behavior together.

**Example:**
```python
class Dog:
    def bark(self):
        print("Woof")
```

---

## 🧬 Day 18 – Inheritance and Polymorphism

**Inheritance** allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, promoting code reuse. **Polymorphism** enables methods to behave differently based on the object calling them, supporting flexible and extensible code.

**Example:**
```python
class Puppy(Dog):
    pass
```
