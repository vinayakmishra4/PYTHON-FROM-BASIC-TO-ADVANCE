# üöÄ DAY-31: Exception Handling

---

## üìñ Definition
**Exception handling** is a structured mechanism in programming that detects and responds to runtime errors or unexpected events during execution. Instead of crashing abruptly, programs **catch and manage exceptions gracefully**, allowing smooth continuation or clean exit.

---

## üìù Syntax
```python
try:
    # Code block where exceptions might occur
except ExceptionType1:
    # Handle ExceptionType1
except ExceptionType2:
    # Handle ExceptionType2
else:
    # Code executed if no exceptions were raised
finally:
    # Code that always runs, regardless of exceptions
````

## üí° Example

Imagine a program that:

* Prompts the user to enter a number.
* Divides 10 by that number.

Possible outcomes:

* Entering **0** triggers a `ZeroDivisionError` which is caught and handled with a message.
* Entering a **non-numeric value** triggers a `ValueError`, handled similarly.
* If **no error** occurs, a success message is shown.
* A **final message** always prints, signaling program completion.

This approach keeps the program **robust, user-friendly, and informative** despite errors.

---

## üåü Features

* **Multiple Exception Handling:** Multiple `except` blocks to handle different exceptions.
* **Clean Separation:** Separates normal code from error-handling logic.
* **Guaranteed Cleanup:** `finally` block always runs, perfect for releasing resources.
* **Custom Exceptions:** Define user-specific exceptions for tailored handling.
* **Exception Propagation:** Unhandled exceptions bubble up for centralized management.

---

## üîß Usage

* Validating and handling **user input** errors.
* Managing **file I/O** errors (e.g., missing or inaccessible files).
* Handling **network-related** issues gracefully.
* Performing **safe arithmetic** operations.
* Ensuring resource cleanup using `finally` (closing files, DB connections).
* Building robust APIs with clear error signaling.

---

## ‚úÖ Advantages

* **Stability:** Prevents program crashes.
* **User-Friendly:** Provides clear, informative error messages.
* **Maintainability:** Isolates error handling for cleaner code.
* **Debugging Aid:** Enables precise identification and logging of errors.
* **Flexibility:** Supports both built-in and custom exceptions.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disadvantages

* Adds **slight performance overhead**.
* Overuse or catching overly broad exceptions can **mask bugs**.
* Excessive nesting can reduce **code readability**.
* Improper flow control after exceptions may cause **unexpected behavior**.
