📘 Day 9: Strings in Python
🔤 What is a String?
A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes.

# Examples:
str1 = 'Hello'
str2 = "World"
str3 = '''Triple quoted string'''

🔒 Immutability of Strings
Strings in Python are immutable — you cannot change their content after creation:

text = "Hello"
# text[0] = 'h'  # ❌ This will raise an error

🧠 Summary
Strings are immutable sequences of characters.

You can access them via indexing and slicing.

Python provides a wide range of built-in string methods.

Use formatting techniques for cleaner outputs.
