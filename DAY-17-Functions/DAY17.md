# 🌟 DAY 17: Functions

---

## 📌 Title:
**Functions in Python**

---

## 📖 Definition:
A **function** is a block of *organized, reusable code* that performs a single, specific task.  
Functions help break programs into smaller, manageable chunks, improving **readability** and reducing **redundancy**.

---

## 🧪 Example:
```python
# Function definition
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Function calls
greet("Alice")
greet("Bob")
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage:
- 🔄 *Organizing* code into logical blocks  
- 🔁 *Reusing* code without duplication  
- 📦 *Encapsulating* complex operations  
- 🎯 *Returning* values after tasks  
- ♻️ *Recursion* — a function calling itself  

---

## 🧩 Types of Functions:
1. 🏗️ **Built-in Functions** – Provided by Python (e.g., `print()`, `len()`)
2. 🛠️ **User-defined Functions** – Created using the `def` keyword
3. ⚡ **Lambda Functions** – Small, anonymous functions using `lambda`
4. 🔁 **Recursive Functions** – Call themselves within their own definition

---

## 🧱 Syntax of a Function:
```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # function body
    return value
```

---

## ✅ Advantages:
- ♻️ **Code Reusability** – Use the same logic without rewriting
- 🧹 **Improved Readability** – Cleaner and well-structured code
- 🧪 **Debugging Ease** – Test and fix small, isolated parts
- 🧭 **Logical Segmentation** – Break tasks into focused units

---

## ⚠️ Disadvantages:
- 🧱 **Overhead** – Too many small functions can be confusing
- 🧵 **Debugging Complexity** – Harder to trace through nested calls
- 🔗 **Dependencies** – May rely on external variables
- 💾 **Memory Usage** – Recursive calls can use a lot of memory

---

## 💡 Pro Tips:
- ✂️ Keep functions *short* and *focused*
- 🏷️ Use *descriptive names* for clarity
- 📘 Add *docstrings* to describe what each function does
